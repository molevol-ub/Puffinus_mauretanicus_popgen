The 9 **numbered** scripts (except script 5) in this directory are to be run in order to obtain a file that summarizes statistics for the specified window size.

After these, 1st you should run the **GC_and_gene** folder and 2nd the **XPEHH** one.

Aisde from these, you will find 4 folders for different complementary analyses that may be useful to perform once you have identified **candidate scaffolds**:
  · **LD**: to generate a linkage disequilibrium heatmap.
  · **GenotypePlot**: to generate genotype plots, which help in visualizing distribution of long haplotypes across our individuals.
  · **PCA_windows**: to generate PCAs across the windows found within the scaffold.
  · **Genes**: to visualize which genes are found within our scaffolds.
