The 3 **numbered** scripts in this file are to be run after **both** the 9 scripts from the main *genome _scans* directory and the 2 scripts from the GC_gene directory have been executed.

This means that you will be using a file that summarizes statistics including GC content and gene density as input.

If you want to plot the results, use the 2nd half of the 4_popgenome.r script in the main *genome_scans* directory
