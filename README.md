# Population genomics in _Puffinus mauretanicus_

# Introduction

This git repository contains those scripts used during the population genomics analyses performed with _Pufifnus mauretanicus_ by the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Group, University of Barcelona.

# Structure

1. **SNP_calling_mitogenome**: SNP calling pipeline which uses freebayes - adapted for mitogenomic data.
2. **Population_structure**: includes those analyses performed to visualize population structure within *P. mauretanicus* and *P. yelkouan*. Among these, we include: PCAs, Struct-f4, TreeMix and haplotype genealogy graphs for mitogenomes (using Fitchi).
3. **Dated_phylogeny**: inference of time-callibrated species trees using SNAPP.
4. **Genome_scans**: performance of genome-wide scans for signatures of selection, including detailed analyses of the main outlier windows.
